            <p>
                When I‚Äôm not working or coding, you‚Äôll find me on my PS5, diving into competitive gaming. 
                My top picks are <strong>NBA 2K</strong>, <strong>Rocket League</strong> and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>. 
                I love testing my skills, challenging others, and having a blast online. 
                If you‚Äôre into gaming too, add me and let‚Äôs play! (PSN: <strong>vLmNukes</strong>)
